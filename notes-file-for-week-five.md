# what I was trying to do
- creating/modifying the grave template 
- annotating the readings
- going over Consolidation Doc, working on mistakes

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
- it connects greatly! For one, it allows for me to go over the values I have collected and dissect the way I've collected them a bit more deeply. 
- It connects to the well to workings of digital archaeology, and allows for me to wittness the truth depth of the pros and cons it possesses (more in journal entry)

## challenges 
- deciding what was needed in the data template, and what was not and try to find a good balance between the more intricate, deep workings of 'slow archaeology' whilst also trying to make the data template as efficient as possible!
- trying to juggle whether my inputs in the data template are meaningful or not


## thoughts on where to go next
- Perhaps try out the R script? Seems a bit scary... considering I know next to nothing about code, but you gotta start somewhere, eh?
- Keep evolving the data sheet, there is always something I could add/delete
