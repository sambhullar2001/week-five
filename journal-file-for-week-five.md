# Introduction 
This week was the most interesting week yet in CLCV 3000... finally we get to do the fun stuff!

From the readings it is evident that this week's main priority, other than going out and collecting information, is collecting information ***ethically***. Ethics has a rough history with archaeology. Originally a "gentleman's hobby" in which rich colonists would take artifacts and other interesting memorials without any regard to it's history or the site itself.... the field has come a long way; and yet still... has a long way ***to go.*** Now that digital archaeology is emerging from a small-niche field into the mainstream, it comes at no surprise that the discourse of ethics is brought up once more.

## Interesting Quotes from the Readings

"*Few cisgender people are aware of the fact that before you step into a scanning machine, the TSA agent operating the machine looks you up and down, decides whether you are a man or a woman, and then pushes a button to select the corresponding gender on the scanner’s touchscreen interface. That human decision loads the algorithmic profile for either male bodies or female ones, against which your body’s measurements are compared. If your measurements diverge from the statistical norm of that gender’s body—whether the discrepancy is because you’re concealing a deadly weapon, because your body doesn’t fit neatly into either of the two categories that the system has provided, or because the TSA agent simply made the wrong choice—you trigger a “risk alert.”*"" (4. “What Gets Counted Counts.” (2020). In Data Feminism. Retrieved from https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/h1w0nbqp) 

The quote above was one that really stood out to me when I was reading the article, as it soldified the fact that we're still so afraid of social deviations as a society. Anything that may go against the grain, even in the *slightest*, is considered scary and foreign - and as such, not dealt with in a manner that is compassionate and kind. 

**Success and Fails**
When writing this section of the journal, I had a bit of difficulty trying to brainstorm successes and fails - as there weren't any blatant examples of both during the duration of my work, especially considering that I had opted to work deeply on one task (adding personal elements to the data templates), rather than try my hand on the other harder ones. 

I don't have a ***tangible success*** to write vividly about, however, I do have something resembling a "***fail***" - which is the lack of confidence in my data elements. Let me know in the feedback if this doesn't constitute as a good 'fail', however I found myself not really having much faith in the elements that I added in the data template. I understand that the goal was to create a template with data elements that we thought were appropriate to "Canadian society" (rather than the British one from which the original DEBS template was based of off), however there was not much I could differentiate between the two; leading to much uncertainty in the elements I either added or got rid of.

**Analyzing the DEBS template**

The DEBS template coding scheme is a very comprehensive template, and I found it quite ***interesting*** to use when conducting my research. 

Now, when I utilised the DEBS template I realized just how physical many of the values that one must input were - with nearly half of the elements asking for measurements of the base. Many of the elements that one Through this, I would argue, that the template attempts to highlight the physical remains of monuments, rather the context and history behind them; putting the latter elements in the "backburner".

In fact, I'd argue that the DEBS model shows hints of obscuring traditional archaeological practice in favour of being more efficient. The concept of 'slow archaeology' was introduced this week, and despite knowing Graham's views on it, I'd argue it is right in it's own regarding. An over-digitization of the field can force academics to choose between efficient methodology and the traditional 'slow' methodology. In one article I was reading, William Caraher argues that by having a digital norm within the field, it can take away from the processes of fieldwork and hinder research. He likens these digital tools to black boxes - stating, "*black boxes hide certain processes or maneuvers either owing to their complexity, their routine character, or their location outside of the expertise of disciplinary work*" (Caraher. 421).

Such a notion felt present during the collection of data, and it felt as if I was confined to the small boxes and tick-marks of the Kobotoolbox form - it felt confining, both academically and literally. It took away from the research experience as a whole... in favour for what? Effiency? Computational organization? Hm.

My mind is still on the fence with digital archaeology. I ***can't hate it***; it's ***literally*** what the premise of this course is... I suppose I'll just have to live with it.
